# iosScreenshotResizer
A .Net core app which resizes provided iphone screenshots to the size wanted by the Apple Store.


Did you try to resize Iphone 6S screenshots to submit it to the Apple Store ? There is a strange rounding issue which force you to do it in two passes. After a few time doing it, I built this app to automatize this process.

This is done using .Net core 1.1 and the SkiaSharp SDK (.net port by Xamarin).

Have fun !
